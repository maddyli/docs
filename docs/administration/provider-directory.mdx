This section provide a series of guides on how to properly model your organization's provider directory. It focuses on a few key challenges:

1. **[How to model the organizational structure of your provider group:](/docs/administration/provider-directory/provider-organizations)** How to represent the clinical divisions and care teams in your clinical organization, including how to represent providers who participate in multiple teams.
2. [**How to model provider participation insurance networks:**](/docs/administration/provider-directory/provider-networks) How to model insurance plans and the in-network/out-of-network status of providers.
3. [**How to model provider qualifications, certifications, and licenses:**](/docs/administration/provider-directory/provider-credentials) How to represent state licensure and specialty certifications for each provider to ensure proper staffing across geography and clinical.

These guides are based on, and compatible with, the [Da Vinci PDEX Payer Network guide](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-pdex-plan-net/). [The Da Vinci Project](http://www.hl7.org/about/davinci/index.cfm) is a private sector initiative comprised of [industry leaders](https://confluence.hl7.org/display/DVP/Da+Vinci+Project+Members), including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, and Optum, etc. working together to accelerate the adoption of FHIR as the standard to support and integrate value-based care (VBC) data exchange.
