description: "Consider the following common scenario:"
---

* You have an existing digital healthcare platform running active operations
* You decided to adopt a standards based architecture, such as Medplum
* You want to migrate operations without service interruption or degradation

While there is some engineering work required to migrate non-FHIR data into Medplum, there are well-known best-practices to manage this process. This series of guides outlines the process of migrating data from an existing platform into Medplum.

It covers:

* [Planning your migration](/docs/migration/migration-planning)
* [Sequencing your migration](/docs/migration/migration-sequence)
* [Converting your data to FHIR](/docs/migration/convert-to-fhir)
* [Building data pipelines](/docs/migration/migration-pipelines)

Our first guide will cover **Planning your Migration**
