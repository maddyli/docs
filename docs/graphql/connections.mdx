title: "Connection API"
description: "Using the normal \"List\" search (i.e., \"PatientList\") is the most common way to search for resources. However, the FHIR GraphQL specification also supports the , which is a more complex way to search for resources."
---

The most immediate advantage of the Connection API is support for retrieving total counts. The Connection API also includes more features from FHIR Bundle such as `mode` and `score`.

To use the Connection API, append "Connection" to the resource type rather than "List". For example, use "PatientConnection" instead of "PatientList".

Here is an example of searching for a list of `Patient` resources using the Connection API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="GraphQL">
    ```
    {  PatientConnection {    count    edges {      resource {        resourceType        id        name { given family }      }    }  }}
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ```
    await medplum.graphql(`{  PatientConnection {    count    edges {      resource {        resourceType        id        name { given family }      }    }  }}`);
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```
    curl -X POST 'https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4/$graphql' \  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  -H "Authorization: Bearer $your_access_token" \  -d '{"query":"{ PatientConnection count { edges { resource { resourceType id name { given family } } } } }"}'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Accordion title="Example Response">
  ```
  data: {  PatientConnection: {    count: 2,    edges: [      {        resource: {          resourceType: 'Patient',          id: 'example-patient-id-1',          name: [            {              given: ['Bart'],              family: 'Simpson',            },          ],        },      },      {        resource: {          resourceType: 'Patient',          id: 'example-patient-id-2',          name: [            {              given: ['Homer'],              family: 'Simpson',            },          ],        },      },    ],  },},
  ```
</Accordion>
