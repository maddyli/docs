Medplum also provides the `createResource` method on the `MedplumClient` which implements the `create` operation. When creating a resource, you do not need to provide an `id`, as it will be assigned by the server.

<Accordion title="Example: Creating a Practitioner">
  * Typescript
  * CLI
  * cURL

  ```
  const practitioner: Practitioner = await medplum.createResource({  resourceType: 'Practitioner',  name: [{ family: 'Smith', given: ['Alice'], prefix: ['Dr.'] }],});
  ```

  ```
  medplum post Practitioner '{"resourceType":"Practitioner","name":[{"family":"Smith","given":["Alice"],"prefix":["Dr."]}]}'
  ```

  ```
  curl -X POST 'https://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4/Practitioner' \  -H 'authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN' \  -H 'content-type: application/fhir+json' \  -d {"resourceType":"Practitioner","name":[{"family":"Smith","given":["Alice"],"prefix":["Dr."]}]}
  ```
</Accordion>
