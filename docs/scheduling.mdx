description: "Scheduling is a common workflow and correct use of the FHIR spec supports many complex scheduling workflows. The scheduling process involves three key steps:"
---

1. [**Defining Availability**](/docs/scheduling/defining-availability) - Administering when each service can be performed in time
2. **Matching Availability** - Ensuring patients are matched to the right scheduled actors based on state, credentials, preferences, etc.
3. **Consuming Availability** - How users actually select and book a unit of availability

| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`Slot`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot)               | Defines a unit of availability for a provider. It can be assigned different appointment and service types.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [`Schedule`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/schedule)       | A grouping resource to collect a set of [`Slots`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot). Schedules can be assigned to [`Practitioner`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner), [`Location`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/location) (facilities or rooms), and [`Patient`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resources. |
| [`Appointment`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment) | A tracking resources to define a booked [`Slot`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot) that may result in one or more [`Encounters`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter).                                                                                                                                          |

## Managing Availability[​](#managing-availability "Direct link to Managing Availability")

To manage provider availability, workflows include a [`Schedule`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/schedule) resource, which has one or more [`Slots`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/slot) of availability.

The [`Schedule` usage documentation](/docs/api/fhir/resources/schedule?section=usage) provides a great overview on how FHIR [`Schedules`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/schedule) can be used to manage availability for different types of actors, including:

* [`Practitioners`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner)
* [`HealthcareServices`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/healthcareservice)
* specific practice [`Locations`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/location)

<Check>
  There are times where it may be appropriate to add a timezone to a [`Practitioner`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner) resource to ensure that appointments are accurately scheduled. However, there is no standard way to do this on the [`Practitioner`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/practitioner) resource, so you will need to add an extension.

  ```
  {  resourceType: 'Practitioner',  // ...  extension: [    {      url: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/timezone",      valueCode: "America/Los­_Angeles"    }  ]}
  ```
</Check>

## Tracking Appointments[​](#tracking-appointments "Direct link to Tracking Appointments")

[`Appointments`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment) represent the booked visit between patient and provider.

The [`Appointment` usage documentation](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment?section=usage) provides a great starting point for understanding the full appointment booking lifecycle.

More advanced workflows can implement the [Appointment request/response model](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment?section=relationships). In this model, participants confirm their availability using [AppointmentResponse](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointmentresponse) resources. [`Appointments`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/appointment) can also be linked to specific [Location](/docs/api/fhir/resources/location), and [Bots](/docs/bots) can be used to enforce other business logic.
