title: "Referral Management"
description: "Building out a referral management experience requires composing multiple FHIR resources into a workflow that meets the requirements of both referring and receiving providers. There are three primary interactions that developers should consider when building out a custom referral management solution:"
---

* **Capturing referral requests** from the referring provider
* **Transmitting referrals** to receiving providers
* **Tracking referral status** throughout the workflow

## Referral Overview[​](#referral-overview "Direct link to Referral Overview")

Here is a **sample** of what a referral management experience might look like - to be clear, referral interfaces can look however you want them to. A sample referral application could be built using Medplum [React components](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs).

When capturing referral information, gathering the essential details using a [Questionnaire](/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire) is a good first step. This can be used to create a [ServiceRequest](/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest) which serves as the core referral resource. You can query all resources related to a given referral from the [ServiceRequest](/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest) endpoint.

Depending on your use case, you might need to include different supporting information such as [Conditions](/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition), [Observations](/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation), or [DocumentReferences](/docs/api/fhir/resources/documentreference). [Search](/docs/search) is useful to construct the specific queries that will give the context needed for a complete referral.

React components are available to aid in building a quick referral experience. [QuestionnaireForm](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-questionnaireform--basic), [ResourceTable](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-resourcetable--basic), [Search control](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-searchcontrol--checkboxes), [ResourceAvatar](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-resourceavatar--image), and [Timeline](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-timeline--basic) are potential components that can speed development of the referral management interface.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`ServiceRequest`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest)               | The primary resource for representing a referral. Contains details about the requested service, priority, and supporting information. |
| [`Task`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/task)                                   | Used to track the status of the referral through its lifecycle (requested, accepted, rejected, in-progress, completed).               |
| [`Questionnaire`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire)                 | Defines structured forms for capturing referral information consistently.                                                             |
| [`QuestionnaireResponse`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaireresponse) | Contains the completed referral form data that can be processed to create a ServiceRequest.                                           |
| [`Communication`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/communication)                 | Represents the transmission of referral information between providers, including attachments and delivery status.                     |
| [`DocumentReference`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/documentreference)         | Used to attach clinical documents, images, or other files to the referral.                                                            |
| [`Condition`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition)                         | Represents diagnoses that justify the reason for the referral.                                                                        |
| [`Observation`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/observation)                     | Contains clinical measurements or findings that support the referral.                                                                 |
