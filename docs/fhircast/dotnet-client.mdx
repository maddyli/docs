Once the solution opens successfully, you can run the test application:

1. Right click on "TestPowerCast" in Solution Explorer
2. Click on "Debug"
3. Click on "Start New Instance"

If all goes well, you should now have a running instance of the test app.

## Connecting to Medplum Server[​](#connecting-to-medplum-server "Direct link to Connecting to Medplum Server")
