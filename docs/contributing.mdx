## Making a contribution[​](#making-a-contribution "Direct link to Making a contribution")

There are several ways to make your first contribution to the Medplum project! The following instructions should help you get started.

### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea[​](#reporting-a-bug-or-discussing-a-feature-idea "Direct link to Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea")

If you found a technical bug on Medplum or have ideas for features we should implement, the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues) is the best place to share your ideas. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues/new) describing the changes you'd like to see, and one of our team members will respond.

### Writing documentation or blog content[​](#writing-documentation-or-blog-content "Direct link to Writing documentation or blog content")

Did you learn how to do something using Medplum but it wasn't obvious on first try? Please contribute to our documentation!

Our documentation is hosted on [medplum.com/docs](/docs), but it is built from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) files that live in our [Github repository](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/packages/docs/docs).

For relatively small changes, you can edit files directly from your web browser on [github.dev](https://github.dev/medplum/medplum/blob/main/packages/docs/docs/home.md) without needing to clone the repository.

### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature[​](#fixing-a-bug-or-implementing-a-new-feature "Direct link to Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature")

If you find a bug on Medplum and open a GitHub Pull Request that fixes it, we'll review it as soon as possible.

Before starting implementation of a new feature, open an issue first to discuss your plans and to ensure it fits into our roadmap and plans for the app. If for some reason we don't accept your PR, you're welcome to [fork our repository](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/fork) and implement it in your own version.

**Ready to get started writing code?** First things first, you need to [clone the Medplum repository](/docs/contributing/local-dev-setup).
