## Events[​](#events "Direct link to Events")

The `MedplumClient` extends the `EventTarget` class and emits several events that can be listened to for insight into state changes around auth and other changes in the internals of `MedplumClient`. These are usually used for triggering rerenders within the context of React, but may also be useful for debugging purposes.

* `profileRefreshing` - The client is actively attempting to refresh your authentication token.
* `profileRefreshed` - The client finished refreshing your authentication token or failed to refresh.
* `storageInitialized` - The client finished initializing your client storage and can now attempt to authenticate.
* `storageInitFailed` - The client failed to initialize storage for some reason and cannot continue in its current state.
* `offline` - The client has lost connection to the server and is currently offline.
* `change` - Generic change occurred in `MedplumClient`, mostly used to force a re-render in React.

## Working with the `MedplumClient` Lifecycle in React[​](#working-with-the-medplumclient-lifecycle-in-react "Direct link to working-with-the-medplumclient-lifecycle-in-react")

When wrapping your app in a `MedplumProvider`, you should be aware of the lifecycle events of `MedplumClient`. Each of the lifecycle events will trigger a rerender at the root of your app; so your root component (what we call by convention in our examples `App.tsx`) should resilient to rerenders. This can be accomplished in most cases with the following pattern:

```
function App() {  const profile = useMedplumProfile();  const navigate = useNavigate();  // Use this to guard against initial load  // After initial load, this code path will always be skipped over  if (medplum.isLoading()) {    return <Loading />;  }  // Use this if you want to unmount the entire app and show a spinner when your profile changes  // This will cause remount on switching profiles  // Or an unmount whenever token refresh fails and a profile is no longer present  if (!profile) {    // Redirect users back to signin whenever there is no profile anytime after initial load    navigate('/signin');    return null;  }  return <RestOfYourApp />;}
```

### `medplum.isLoading()` vs `useMedplumContext().loading`[​](#medplumisloading-vs-usemedplumcontextloading "Direct link to medplumisloading-vs-usemedplumcontextloading")

Historically `medplum.isLoading()` and `useMedplumContext().loading` signalled slightly different things, born out of the special-case of using `MedplumClient` with `ExpoClientStorage` for React Native, where there was a separate step of initializing the storage asynchronously before authentication could take place. However, both of these values should now always be in sync with each other, and they can be used interchangeably as of version `3.1.9`.
