description: "Building out a charting experience requires composing multiple FHIR resources into an experience that meets the requirements of practitioners. There are three primary interactions that developers should consider when building out a custom charting experience:"
---

* **Summarizing patient history** and status
* **Capturing clinical notes**
* **Placing orders** for medications, labs, imaging, etc.

## Patient History[​](#patient-history "Direct link to Patient History")

Here is a **sample** of what a charting experience might look like - to be clear, charting can look however you want it to. A sample charting application built off of Medplum [React components](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs) and be found on [medplum-provider github](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/examples/medplum-provider).

![Chart sample](/images/docs/assets/images/charting-screenshot-446176d02d4181d3002b00748991a714.png)

When summarizing patient history, gathering demographic data from the [Patient](/docs/api/fhir/resources/patient) resource is a basic first step. You can also query all resources related to a given patient from the [Patient `$everything`](/docs/api/fhir/operations/patient-everything) endpoint.

Depending on your use case, `$everything` may be verbose to summarize in a chart, so queries for specific resources like active [CarePlans](/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan), [MedicationRequests](/docs/api/fhir/resources/medicationrequest), [Conditions](/docs/api/fhir/resources/condition) may be more appropriate. [Search](/docs/search) is useful to construct the specific queries that will give the context needed for a chart.

React components are available to aid in building a quick charting experience. [PatientTimeline](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-patienttimeline--patient), [Timeline](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-timeline--basic), [Search control](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-searchcontrol--checkboxes), [ResourceAvatar](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-resourceavatar--image), [FhirPathDisplay](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-fhirpathdisplay--id) and Tabs are potential components that can speed development of the summarized history.

## Encounter & Charting[​](#encounter-charting "Direct link to Encounter & Charting")

### Capturing Notes[​](#capturing-notes "Direct link to Capturing Notes")

A wide variety of notes experiences are possible, and customizability is one of the key reasons to use a headless system. From a technical perspective, after a practitioner/patient interaction is complete, a set of appropriate FHIR resources should be created.

Some implementations have a simple text box and allow the practitioner to enter text free form, then construct [Encounter](/docs/api/fhir/resources/encounter) and/or [ClinicalImpression](/docs/api/fhir/resources/clinicalimpression) resources.

Some implementations have a library of [Questionnaires](/docs/questionnaires) that practitioners fill out and use [Bots](/docs/bots) to drive workflow and create resources in a specific way.

## Placing Orders[​](#placing-orders "Direct link to Placing Orders")

Placing orders requires constructing the right resources, which can be created directly or via [`Questionnaires`](/docs/api/fhir/resources/questionnaire) and [`Bots`](/docs/api/fhir/medplum/bot). Refer to our section on [Labs and Imaging](/docs/labs-imaging) or [Prescriptions](/docs/medications/representing-prescriptions-and-medication-orders) for more details.
