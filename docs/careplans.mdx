title: "Overview"
description: "Care Plans are representations of protocols that patients are meant to follow. They exist in two modes:"
---

* **In abstract**, a protocol that could apply to a *hypothetical patient*, which is represented in FHIR as a [PlanDefinition](/docs/api/fhir/resources/plandefinition).
* **In concrete**, a protocol that is planned for a *specific patient*, the PlanDefinition is instantiated (in FHIR terms, they call this `$apply`) into an optional [CarePlan](/docs/api/fhir/resources/careplan) with a linked [RequestGroup](/docs/api/fhir/resources/requestgroup) representing all the items that need to be done and their status.

It can be helpful to think of the historical analogs to these resources in the physical world. A `PlanDefinition` can be thought of as a written manual or protocol document that would be given to staff for training. A `CarePlan`/`RequestGroup` can be thought of a checklist that is added to a patient chart.

<Warning>
  Feel free to reach out to us at [hello@medplum.com](mailto:hello@medplum.com) if you have questions about your care plan setup.
</Warning>

Care planning can range from very simple - for example, a single prescription, to very complex - like a surgery with post operative follow up, evaluations, medications and more. For basic use, we recommend looking at reference care plans and customizing them to your needs.

* [PlanDefinitions on Medplum App](https://app.medplum.com/PlanDefinition) - if you look at the tabs, you will see an `$apply` tab that allows you to convert a PlanDefinition into a RequestGroup that belongs to a specific patient.
