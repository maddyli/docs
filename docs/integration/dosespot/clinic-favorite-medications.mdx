* Reduce prescription time for clinicians to prescribe frequently prescribed medications

## How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

When clinicians access the DoseSpot eRx iframe through Medplum, they'll see an option to start with one of your organization's favorite medications displayed when creating a new prescription. This allows them to:

1. **Quickly select** from your organization's favorite medications
2. **Input Prescription Specifics:** Edit any of the default details for the medication, like the strength, patient instructions, or dispense type that might need to be customized for this specific prescription
3. **Save** the prescription

## Setting Up Clinic Favorite Medications[​](#setting-up-clinic-favorite-medications "Direct link to Setting Up Clinic Favorite Medications")

The following step-by-step guide, using the [Medplum Provider App DoseSpot page](https://provider.medplum.com/integrations/dosespot), will walk you through configuring favorite medications in DoseSpot for your organization.

**1. Use the [Medplum Provider App DoseSpot page](https://provider.medplum.com/integrations/dosespot) to add a new DoseSpot favorite medication.**

This Medplum Provider App DoseSpot page is an **unopinionated example of a favorite medication management page**. The building blocks for it are in the *useDoseSpotClinicFormulary* hook from the [Medplum react hooks](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/packages/dosespot-react) package. You can use this hook to build your own favorite medication management page, using your own frontend patterns and components.

The Provider App example implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/tree/main/examples/medplum-provider/src/pages/integrations/DoseSpotFavoritesPage.tsx).

<Info>
  This feature requires your Medplum User to be configured as a DoseSpot `ClinicianAdmin`. Contact [Medplum support](mailto:support@medplum.com) for help with this.
