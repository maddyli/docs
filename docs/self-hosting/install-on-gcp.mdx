<Warning>
  This deployment option has been validated for production use and offers a robust foundation for your implementation. However, it provides a less-automated setup and requires significant operational expertise.

  This is a complex multi-step process, and requires high proficiency with GCP, Terraform, Node.js, and command line tools.

  Medplum strives to make this as easy as possible, but despite our best efforts, it is still challenging.

  If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:hello@medplum.com) or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/medplum).
</Warning>

## High-level overview[​](#high-level-overview "Direct link to High-level overview")

To deploy Medplum in GCP, the process is divided into two parts:

* Static Infrastructure (using terraform)
* Medplum App (helm chart)

This division allows a fully customizable deployment, for example: if a customer wants to use an existing GKE cluster, they can just deploy the helm chart to it.

The Medplum application is configured using a secret in GCP Secrets Manager. See [Generate Configuration Secret](#generate-configuration-secret)

### GCP Architecture[​](#gcp-architecture "Direct link to GCP Architecture")

![Medplum GCP Architecture](/images/docs/self-hosting/assets/images/gcp-architecture-28b55e90c68e49c1911b3d65a23a0499.webp)

### Infrastructure summary[​](#infrastructure-summary "Direct link to Infrastructure summary")

* The Medplum backend (API) container runs in GKE.

  * The API is exposed using Ingress, which creates a GCP Load Balancer
  * The Load balancer has a WAF (Cloud Armor)
  * Google-managed certificates are used

* We use managed Redis (Memorystore) and Cloud SQL for cache and PostgreSQL

* All outbound connections go through a Cloud NAT (fixed IP)

* There bottom Load Balancer is deployed using terraform, and it is used to expose the frontend (app) and storage buckets, using Google CDN

  * The Load balancer has a WAF (Cloud Armor)
  * Google-managed certificates are used

### High-level deployment process[​](#high-level-deployment-process "Direct link to High-level deployment process")

1. Deploy static infrastructure (GKE, CloudSQL, Redis, Storage Buckets, LB)
2. With the values from Step 1, create the Medplum app configuration
3. With the values from Step 1, point the DNS records
4. Deploy the backend application using the helm chart
5. Copy the frontend files to the CDN bucket

## GCP Deployment[​](#gcp-deployment "Direct link to GCP Deployment")

### Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)[​](#infrastructure-deployment "Direct link to Infrastructure Deployment (Terraform)")

The `terraform` folder contains **Terraform** configurations for deploying infrastructure on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. The setup includes a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**, **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster**, **Cloud SQL**, **Cloud Storage Buckets**, **Redis**, and more.

#### Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) installed on your local machine.
* A **GCP** account with the necessary permissions to create resources.
* A **GCP** project where the resources will be deployed.
* **Google Cloud SDK** installed and authenticated with your GCP account.

#### Clone the Repository[​](#clone-the-repository "Direct link to Clone the Repository")

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/medplum/medplumcd terraform/gcp/
```

#### Configure Backend (Optional)[​](#configure-backend "Direct link to Configure Backend (Optional)")

If you want to use a [remote backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend) for storing the Terraform state, uncomment and configure the backend.tf file.

#### Initialize Terraform[​](#initialize-terraform "Direct link to Initialize Terraform")

Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to enter your project-specific values:

```
# GCP project configuration - Change these values to use your own project, region, and zoneproject_id = "your-project-id"region     = "your-region"zone       = "your-zone"# Common enforced labels - Change these values to use your own labelslabels = {  env     = "your-environment"  # e.g., "dev", "staging", "prod"  purpose = "your-purpose"      # e.g., "gke", "web", "database"  owner   = "your-owner"        # e.g., "team-name", "project-owner"}
```

#### Initialize Terraform[​](#initialize-terraform-1 "Direct link to Initialize Terraform")

Initialize the Terraform working directory to download the necessary provider plugins and modules:

```
terraform init
```

#### Plan the Deployment[​](#plan-the-deployment "Direct link to Plan the Deployment")

Generate and review an execution plan to ensure the configuration is correct:

```
terraform plan
```

#### Apply the Configuration[​](#apply-the-configuration "Direct link to Apply the Configuration")

Apply the Terraform configuration to create the resources in GCP:

```
terraform apply
```

### Generate configuration secret[​](#generate-configuration-secret "Direct link to Generate configuration secret")

The configuration secret holds the Medplum application configuration and it contains the connection strings to the rest of the infrastructure that we deployed before, using terraform.

**1. Create the Secret in Secret Manager:**

Use the gcloud secrets create command to create a new secret with automatic replication and labels.

```
gcloud secrets create config-secret --replication-policy="automatic"
```

**2. Prepare the Secret Data:**

Create a JSON file containing your secret data. Save it as secret\_data.json.

```
cat <<EOF > secret_data.json{  "port": 8103,  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8103/",  "issuer": "http://localhost:8103/",  "audience": "http://localhost:8103/",  "jwksUrl": "http://localhost:8103/.well-known/jwks.json",  "authorizeUrl": "http://localhost:8103/oauth2/authorize",  "tokenUrl": "http://localhost:8103/oauth2/token",  "userInfoUrl": "http://localhost:8103/oauth2/userinfo",  "appBaseUrl": "http://localhost:3000/",  "binaryStorage": "file:./binary/",  "storageBaseUrl": "http://localhost:8103/storage/",  "supportEmail": "\"Medplum\" <support@medplum.com>",  "googleClientId": "397236612778-c0b5tnjv98frbo1tfuuha5vkme3cmq4s.apps.googleusercontent.com",  "googleClientSecret": "",  "recaptchaSiteKey": "6LfHdsYdAAAAAC0uLnnRrDrhcXnziiUwKd8VtLNq",  "recaptchaSecretKey": "6LfHdsYdAAAAAH9dN154jbJ3zpQife3xaiTvPChL",  "adminClientId": "2a4b77f2-4d4e-43c6-9b01-330eb5ca772f",  "maxJsonSize": "1mb",  "maxBatchSize": "50mb",  "botLambdaRoleArn": "",  "botLambdaLayerName": "medplum-bot-layer",  "vmContextBotsEnabled": true,  "defaultBotRuntimeVersion": "vmcontext",  "allowedOrigins": "*",  "introspectionEnabled": true,  "database": {    "host": "YOUR_DB_HOST",    "port": 5432,    "dbname": "medplum",    "username": "medplum",    "password": "medplum"  },  "redis": {    "host": "YOUR_REDIS_HOST",    "port": 6379  },  "bullmq": {    "removeOnFail": { "count": 1 },    "removeOnComplete": { "count": 1 }  },  "shutdownTimeoutMilliseconds": 30000,  "chainedSearchWithReferenceTables": true}EOF
```

* Replace **YOUR\_DB\_HOST** and **YOUR\_REDIS\_HOST** with the actual hostnames or IP addresses of your database and Redis instances.
* Ensure the JSON content is correctly formatted and that any variables or placeholders are replaced with actual values.
* See \[/docs/self-hosting/presigned-urls] to setup presigned URLs

**3. Add a New Secret Version with the Secret Data:**

Use the gcloud secrets versions add command to add the secret data to your secret.

```
gcloud secrets versions add config-secret --data-file=secret_data.json
```

### Configure DNS[​](#configure-dns "Direct link to Configure DNS")

After deploying the infrastructure, you need to point your domains to the external load balancer created by Terraform.

**Obtain Load Balancer IP Address:**

Retrieve the external IP address of the CDN external load balancer:

```
gcloud compute addresses list --global --filter="name=('medplum-elb')"
```

Note the IP address associated with medplum-elb.

* **Update DNS Records:** In your DNS provider’s management console, create A records pointing your domains to the load balancer’s IP address:
* **For `storage.example.com`:** Create an A record for storage.example.com pointing to the load balancer’s IP.
* **For `app.example.com`:** Create an A record for app.example.com pointing to the same load balancer’s IP.

This ensures that traffic to these domains is routed through the CDN-enabled load balancer, which serves content from your backend buckets configured in Terraform.

### Deploy APP Using Helm[​](#deploy-app-using-helm "Direct link to Deploy APP Using Helm")

The Helm chart is a package that contains `yaml` templates that represents Kubernetes Objects.

The helm chart can be found in the `helm` directory.

**It will deploy:**

* Deployment
* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
* Service
* Ingress with GCP Managed Certificate and Backend Config (Cloud Armor)
  * The ingress is optional. Users can choose to expose the API with other methods
* Service Account

#### Deploy your backend API to the GKE cluster using Helm:[​](#deploy-your-backend-api-to-the-gke-cluster-using-helm "Direct link to Deploy your backend API to the GKE cluster using Helm:")

#### Configure kubectl[​](#configure-kubectl "Direct link to Configure kubectl")

Get credentials for your GKE cluster:

```
gcloud container clusters get-credentials medplum-gke --region your-region --project your-project-id
```

Replace your-region and your-project-id with your actual values.

**Note:** Ensure your local machine’s public IP address is included in the master\_authorized\_networks in your Terraform GKE configuration to allow access to the cluster. To find your public IP address:

```
curl ifconfig.me
```

Update the master\_authorized\_networks in your terraform.tfvars configuration accordingly:

```
master_authorized_networks = [  {    cidr_block   = "your-public-ip/32"    display_name = "Your Machine"  },]
```

Reapply the Terraform configuration if you make changes:

```
terraform apply
```

#### Navigate to Your Helm Chart Directory[​](#navigate-to-your-helm-chart-directory "Direct link to Navigate to Your Helm Chart Directory")

```
cd medplum/helm
```

#### Edit the values.yaml File[​](#edit-the-values.yaml-file "Direct link to Edit the values.yaml File")

Edit the values.yaml file to override default values, specifying your cloud provider, project\_id and config\_sicret\_id:

```
global:  cloudProvider: gcp # Supported values: gcp. # roadmap: aws, azure  gcp:    projectId: [MY_PROJECT_ID] # Your Google Cloud Platform project ID    secretId: [MY_CONFIG_SECRET_ID] # The secret ID for configuration in Google Cloud Platform
```

Replace `[MY_PROJECT_ID]` with your actual GCP project id. Replace [`[MY_CONFIG_SECRET_ID]`](#generate-configuration-secret) with the secret name created the step before.

#### Edit service account values[​](#edit-service-account-values "Direct link to Edit service account values")

```
serviceAccount:  annotations:    iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: [MY_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT] # Your Google Cloud Platform service account e.i: medplum-server@[MY_PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

Replace `[MY_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT]` with your actual GCP service account which was created by terraform and its name is `medplum-server@[MY_PROJECT_ID].iam.gserviceaccount.com`

**Edit ingress values:**

(ingress is optional, customers can choose to use whatever method they like to expose the app)

```
ingress:  deploy: true  domain: api.yourdomain.com
```

Replace `api.yourdomain.com` with your actual domain.

**Install the Application:**

```
helm install medplum-server . -n medplum --create-namespace -f values.yaml
```

Note: “.” is the `./path-to-your-helm-chart.` The `values.yam`l is in the same directory as helm chart

* **Update DNS Records:**

Obtain the IP address of the Ingress:

```
kubectl get ingress medplum-server --namespace medplumNAME             CLASS    HOSTS                     ADDRESS        PORTS   AGEmedplum-server   <none>   api.yourdomain.com        34.8.101.254   80      18h
```

Update your DNS records to point api.yourdomain.com to the Ingress IP address.

This is the backend API endpoint.

## Deploy the frontend (App)[​](#deploy-the-frontend-\(app\) "Direct link to Deploy the frontend (App)")

Serve your frontend application through Cloud Storage and the CDN-enabled load balancer.

* **Upload to Cloud Storage:** Use the `deploy-app-gcp.sh` to deploy the frontend static contents to the CDN bucket
* **Content Delivery via CDN:** The CDN external load balancer serves content from the backend buckets (medplum-static-assets and medplum-user-content) associated with app.yourdomain.com and storage.yourdomain.com. Ensure your content is uploaded to the correct buckets for the CDN to serve.
* **Update DNS Records (If Necessary):** Ensure that app.yourdomain.com points to the load balancer’s IP address (already configured in step 7).

#### Post-Deployment Verification[​](#post-deployment-verification "Direct link to Post-Deployment Verification")

**Check Backend API:**

Test the API endpoint:

```
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health
```

You should receive a successful response indicating the API is operational.

**Check Frontend Application:**

Visit [https://app.example.com](https://app.example.com) in a web browser to ensure it’s serving correctly and interacting with the backend API.

## Clean Up Resources (Optional)[​](#clean-up-resources "Direct link to Clean Up Resources (Optional)")

If you need to tear down the infrastructure, use:

```
terraform destroy
```

**Note:** This will destroy all resources created by Terraform, including the GKE cluster and load balancer.

#### By following these steps, you will[​](#by-following-these-steps-you-will "Direct link to By following these steps, you will")

* **Deploy Your Backend API** to a secure, private GKE cluster using Helm, as expected.
* **Configure Access** to your GKE cluster by updating master\_authorized\_networks.
* **Use Helm** to manage your Kubernetes deployments efficiently.
* **Serve Your Frontend Application** via Cloud Storage and the CDN-enabled load balancer.
* **Leverage the ELB Configuration** to efficiently deliver content through CDN.

## Important Notes[​](#important-notes "Direct link to Important Notes")

**Public IP Address:** Ensure your local machine’s public IP is included in the master\_authorized\_networks to access the GKE cluster.

```
master_authorized_networks = [  {    cidr_block   = "your-public-ip/32"    display_name = "Your Machine"  },]
```

• **Replace Placeholder Values:** Ensure all placeholder values (e.g., your-project-id, your-region, yourdomain.com, your-public-ip) are replaced with your actual project-specific values.
