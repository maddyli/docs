description: "When building an EHR, you often want to change the logo and name of your platform for clarity or branding. In Medplum, this is simple:"
---

1. Get your Logo ready
2. Edit your `packages/app/.env` file
3. Build and see your results

## Adding Your Logo[​](#adding-your-logo "Direct link to Adding Your Logo")

### Local file[​](#local-file "Direct link to Local file")

Drop your logo into the static folder:

```
packages/app/static/img/your-logo.svg
```

Files in `packages/app/static/` are served at the root of your app, so this becomes `/img/your-logo.svg`.

### External URL[​](#external-url "Direct link to External URL")

Or host your logo elsewhere and use the full URL:

```
https://cdn.example.com/your-logo.svg
```

<Check>
  Use SVG format when possible — they scale perfectly and have smaller file sizes.
</Check>

## Configuration[​](#configuration "Direct link to Configuration")

Add your branding variables to `packages/app/.env`:

### Environment Variables[​](#environment-variables "Direct link to Environment Variables")

```
MEDPLUM_LOGO_URL=/img/your-logo.svgMEDPLUM_APP_NAME=Your Health Platform
```

<Note>
  These are **build-time** variables. You must rebuild the app after any changes.
</Note>

Then build and run:

```
cd packages/appnpm run buildnpm run dev
```

For production deployments, see [Install from scratch](/docs/self-hosting/install-from-scratch) or [Install on AWS](/docs/self-hosting/install-on-aws).

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

**Logo not showing?**

* Check the file exists at the path you specified
* Make sure you rebuilt after changing `.env`
* Clear your browser cache

**App name not changing?**

* Variable must be exactly `MEDPLUM_APP_NAME`
* Rebuild and clear cache
