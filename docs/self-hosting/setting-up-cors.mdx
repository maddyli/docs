title: "Setting Up CORS"
description: "When self-hosting, you may run into a  error when trying to run your app on . If you do, you will need to ensure that you have set  as an allowed origin on your server."
---

To do so, you will need to add it to the `allowedOrigins` field on your server config settings. By default, the only allowed origin is `[apiBaseUrl].com`, but you can add more in a comma-separated list. For more details, see the [Config Settings docs](/docs/self-hosting/server-config).

<Check>
  To give all origins access to make [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) requests, you can use the special allow all case by setting: `allowedOrigins: '*'`.
