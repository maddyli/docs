## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

### AWS CLI Setup[​](#aws-cli-setup "Direct link to AWS CLI Setup")

It is recommended to setup the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) by following [these instructions](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

### AWS Credentials Setup[​](#aws-credentials-setup "Direct link to AWS Credentials Setup")

AWS CLI and credentials are required by `medplum aws init` automate certain tasks, such as creating public key pairs.

If you have not already done so, follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) to set up your AWS credentials file.

### AWS Account Number[​](#aws-account-number "Direct link to AWS Account Number")

The Medplum `aws init` command will ask for your AWS Account Number.

If the AWS CLI and credentials are configured, then the tool will automatically identify your AWS Account Number.

If not, you can [find your AWS Account Number](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/buyerguide/GettingSupport.html):

1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) with your user name.
2. In the top navigation bar, choose Support and then choose Support Center.
3. Your AWS account ID (account number) appears below the top navigation bar.

### AWS Permissions[​](#aws-permissions "Direct link to AWS Permissions")

You will need permission to access the following AWS services:

| Service                              | Details                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)          | Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and related security groups                      |
| Elasticache                          | Create a hosted Redis cluster for caching and task queue                              |
| Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)         | Create a load balancer for server redundancy and high availability                    |
| Identity and Access Management (IAM) | Create service roles for the API server and bot lambdas                               |
| CloudFront                           | Securely deliver content with low latency and high transfer speeds                    |
| CloudWatch Logs                      | Create and manage log groups for server logs                                          |
| Relational Database Service (RDS)    | Create a hosted Postgres Aurora database                                              |
| Route 53                             | Create DNS entries for the services                                                   |
| Simple Storage Service (S3)          | Host static web content, store and retrieve dynamic user content for file attachments |
| Secrets Manager                      | Store encrypted secret configuration details such as database credentials             |
| Systems Manager (SSM)                | Store configuration details                                                           |
| Web Application Firewall (WAF)       | Protect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits and bots            |

### Configure your name servers[​](#configure-your-name-servers "Direct link to Configure your name servers")

Medplum strongly recommends configuring your domain to use [Amazon's Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html) as your custom DNS name server. This will make it much easier to set up SSL certificates for the [Medplum App](/docs/app) and [Medplum Binary Storage](/docs/fhir-datastore/binary-data).

If you choose not to go this route, you will be responsible for setting up your own SSL certificates.

### Setup SES[​](#setup-ses "Direct link to Setup SES")

It is **strongly** recommended to setup an SES email address with production access, meaning that it can send email to any email recipient. Email is used to verify identities, send login instructions, and handle password reset requests.

Follow the [Creating and verifying identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/creating-identities.html) guide to register an email address for system generated emails.

### Choose an environment name[​](#choose-an-environment-name "Direct link to Choose an environment name")

Throughout this document, instructions will refer to an "environment name". This environment name is used in multiple places, for example an environment named `demo` will result in:

1. As part of config file names (i.e., `medplum.demo.config.json`)
2. As the base of CloudFormation stack names (i.e., `MedplumDemo`)
3. AWS Parameter Store keys (i.e., `/medplum/demo/...`)

If you plan to deploy multiple Medplum clusters, you may want to consider a naming strategy.

For example:

| Env Name | Config file name              | CloudFormation stack name | Parameter Store prefix |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| prod     | `medplum.prod.config.json`    | `MedplumProd`             | `/medplum/prod/...`    |
| staging  | `medplum.staging.config.json` | `MedplumStaging`          | `/medplum/staging/...` |
| test     | `medplum.test.config.json`    | `MedplumTest`             | `/medplum/test/...`    |
| alice    | `medplum.alice.config.json`   | `MedplumAlice`            | `/medplum/alice/...`   |
| bob      | `medplum.bob.config.json`     | `MedplumBob`              | `/medplum/bob/...`     |

Medplum configuration files and environment names are quite flexible, but it is always recommended to be consistent and stay organized.

## Setup a config repo[​](#setup-a-config-repo "Direct link to Setup a config repo")

### Create your config repo[​](#create-your-config-repo "Direct link to Create your config repo")

Medplum recommends creating a separate git repository and npm project to manage your CDK infra-as-code. This repository will only contain JSON configuration files.

```
mkdir my-medplum-cdk-configcd my-medplum-cdk-confignpm init -y
```

Medplum recommends pushing this git repository to your source control provider such as GitHub or GitLab.

### Add CDK dependencies[​](#add-cdk-dependencies "Direct link to Add CDK dependencies")

If you have not already done so, add the common AWS CDK dependencies. This includes all of the base CDK capabilities and constructs.

```
npm i aws-cdk-lib cdk constructs
```

### Add Medplum dependencies[​](#add-medplum-dependencies "Direct link to Add Medplum dependencies")

Add the Medplum CDK and CLI dependencies. This includes the Medplum CDK construct.

```
npm i @medplum/cdk @medplum/cli
```

### Add cdk.json[​](#add-cdkjson "Direct link to Add cdk.json")

Create a new file called `cdk.json` with the following contents:

```
{  "app": "node node_modules/@medplum/cdk/dist/cjs/index.cjs"}
```

### Run the init tool[​](#run-the-init-tool "Direct link to Run the init tool")

Most AWS resources are automatically created using CDK, but some either cannot or are not recommended. Use the `medplum aws init` command to setup those resources and build the Medplum CDK config file.

```
npx medplum aws init
```

Then follow the prompts.

Upon completion, the tool will:

1. Generate a Medplum CDK config file (i.e., medplum.demo.config.json)
2. Optionally generate an AWS CloudFront signing key
3. Optionally request SSL certificates from AWS Certificate Manager
4. Optionally write server config settings to AWS Parameter Store

Make note of the CDK config file name.

See [Config Settings](/docs/self-hosting/aws-cdk-settings) for more details on each of the individual configuration settings.

<Warning>
  After the init tool completes, check all parameters in **AWS Systems Manager > Parameter Store**.

  Ensure that all signing keys and configuration values are present (there should be approximately 13 parameters). If any are missing, you may run into deployment issues.
</Warning>

### (Optional) Validate Certificates[​](#optional-validate-certificates "Direct link to (Optional) Validate Certificates")

If you are using Route 53 as your DNS service, we recommend you select `dns` method for validating domain ownership.

Then, follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/dns-validation.html#setting-up-dns-validation) from AWS to finish the validation process.

<Check>
  After creating records in Route 53, you may have to wait for your certificate in AWS Certificate Manager to change from `Pending validation` to `Issued` state before deploying. If the state doesn't change to `Issued` in 30 minutes, check on the status of your domain. AWS will reject your deploy without a fully-qualified domain for the certificate.
</Check>

If you encounter issues with certificate validation, check the following:

* **Regional Certificates**: If your cluster is not in `us-east-1`, ensure you validate the certificate for the API (in your region) **AND** the 2 CloudFront certificates (in `us-east-1`).
* **Name Servers**: If the certificate remains in `Pending validation` until timeout, the domain may not be pointing to AWS. You may need to configure the Name Servers on your registrar to point to the 4 NS values in your Route 53 Hosted Zone.

### CDK Bootstrap[​](#cdk-bootstrap "Direct link to CDK Bootstrap")

Bootstrapping is the process of provisioning resources for the AWS CDK before you can deploy AWS CDK apps into an AWS environment.

Run CDK bootstrap:

```
npx cdk bootstrap -c config=medplum.demo.config.json
```

Learn more about bootstrapping: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html)

### CDK Synth[​](#cdk-synth "Direct link to CDK Synth")

The `synth` step catches logical errors in defining your AWS resources.

Run CDK synth:

```
npx cdk synth -c config=medplum.demo.config.json
```

### CDK Diff[​](#cdk-diff "Direct link to CDK Diff")

Use the `diff` command to see how it will change your AWS resources.

Run CDK diff:

```
npx cdk diff -c config=medplum.demo.config.json
```

### CDK Deploy[​](#cdk-deploy "Direct link to CDK Deploy")

When you are ready to actually execute the CDK configuration, use the `deploy` command.

Run CDK deploy:

```
npx cdk deploy --all -c config=medplum.demo.config.json
```

Note that you may receive warnings about changing security details. This is normal and expected anytime CDK makes changes to VPC, IAM, and other security features.

### Update Bucket Policies[​](#update-bucket-policies "Direct link to Update Bucket Policies")

When deploying to any region other than `us-east-1`, there is one additional step. AWS CloudFront needs access to S3 buckets. At present, this is not possible entirely within CDK.

<Info>
  This is due to cross-region circular dependencies:

  1. An S3 bucket in your primary region
  2. A CloudFront distribution in `us-east-1`, because CloudFront distributions must always be in `us-east-1`
  3. Updated S3 bucket policy that references the CloudFront distribution

  See this [Github issue](https://github.com/medplum/medplum/issues/2901) for more details.
</Info>

The Medplum CLI includes a command to update the bucket policy automatically:

```
npx medplum aws update-bucket-policies [env name]
```

For example:

```
npx medplum aws update-bucket-policies demo
```

You can use the `--dryrun` option to preview the changes:

```
npx medplum aws update-bucket-policies [env name] --dryrun
```

### Deploy the app[​](#deploy-the-app "Direct link to Deploy the app")

<Check>
  Historically this step required building from source. You can now deploy the app from prebuilt images.
</Check>

Use the Medplum CLI to deploy the app:

```
npx medplum aws deploy-app [env name]
```

For example:

```
npx medplum aws deploy-app demo
```

## Advanced[​](#advanced "Direct link to Advanced")

### Bot Lambda Layer[​](#bot-lambda-layer "Direct link to Bot Lambda Layer")

**Optional:** If you intend to use Medplum Bots, you will need an [AWS Lambda Layer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/gettingstarted-concepts.html#gettingstarted-concepts-layer).

At present, the bot layer must be built from source. See [Clone the repo](/docs/contributing/local-dev-setup#clone-the-repo).

After you successfully clone the Medplum repo, you can use the `deploy-bot-layer.sh` script to build and deploy the Lambda Layer:

```
git clone https://github.com/medplum/medplum.git medplumcd medplum./scripts/deploy-bot-layer.sh
```

See the [Medplum Bot Layer](/docs/bots/bot-lambda-layer) guide to learn more.

## Ongoing[​](#ongoing "Direct link to Ongoing")

### Upgrade AWS infrastructure[​](#upgrade-aws-infrastructure "Direct link to Upgrade AWS infrastructure")

Use CDK to upgrade the infrastructure.

First run `cdk diff` to check for changes:

```
npx cdk diff -c config=medplum.[env name].config.json
```

Then run `cdk deploy` to apply changes:

```
npx cdk deploy -c config=medplum.[env name].config.json
```

### Upgrade the app[​](#upgrade-the-app "Direct link to Upgrade the app")

Use the Medplum CLI to upgrade the app. This will upgrade your app to the latest version.

```
npx medplum aws update-app [env name]
```

For example:

```
npx medplum aws update-app demo
```

### Upgrade the server[​](#upgrade-the-server "Direct link to Upgrade the server")

Use the Medplum CLI to upgrade the server. This will upgrade your server to the latest version.

```
npx medplum aws update-server [env name]
```

For example:

```
npx medplum aws update-server demo
```

### Update the Server Config[​](#update-the-server-config "Direct link to Update the Server Config")

Use the Medplum CLI to update the [server configuration settings](/docs/self-hosting/server-config).

First, create a new configuration file called `medplum.[env name].server.json` to store the server config settings.

Then run the `update-config` command.

```
npx medplum aws update-config medplum.[env name].server.json
```

For example:

```
npx medplum aws update-config medplum.demo.server.json
```

Check out our documentation [server configuration settings](/docs/self-hosting/server-config) to see a full reference of of settings.

### Step 5 - Deploy the server[​](#step-5---deploy-the-server "Direct link to Step 5 - Deploy the server")

Now you are ready to deploy the server.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

### Inaccessible App or API[​](#inaccessible-app-or-api "Direct link to Inaccessible App or API")

If `app.[basedomain]` or `api.[basedomain]` are inaccessible from the browser:

1. **Check Bucket Policies**: Ensure that the CloudFront distribution has access to the S3 Bucket. Double check that you ran the `update-bucket-policies` command to ensure bucket policies are set correctly.

2. **Check Method**: Go to the hosted zone in Route 53 and verify records for `app.[basedomain]` and `api.[basedomain]` exist. If not, create them manually:

   * `app` points to the CloudFront distribution.
   * `api` points to the Load Balancer.

### Cannot assume role[​](#cannot-assume-role "Direct link to Cannot assume role")

You may receive a warning such as:

```
current credentials could not be used to assume 'arn:aws:iam::[ACCOUNT_ID]:role/cdk-hnb659fds-file-publishing-role-[ACCOUNT_ID]-us-west-2',but are for the right account. Proceeding anyway.
```

First, make sure that the specified role exists in your AWS account. If it does not exist, make sure that you ran the `cdk bootstrap` command.

Next, make sure that your AWS account has permission to assume the role via `sts:AssumeRole`. You may need to add an IAM policy to add permission.

```
{  "Sid": "assumerole",  "Effect": "Allow",  "Action": ["sts:AssumeRole", "iam:PassRole"],  "Resource": ["arn:aws:iam::*:role/cdk-*"]}
```

<Check>
  "IAM Full Access" is not enough! The IAM Full Access policy does not include `sts:AssumeRole`.
</Check>

### Try verbose mode[​](#try-verbose-mode "Direct link to Try verbose mode")

All CDK operations support verbose logging by adding the `--verbose` flag. Verbose logging can often reveal hints about confusing behavior.

```
npx cdk synth --verbose -c config=medplum.demo.config.json
```
