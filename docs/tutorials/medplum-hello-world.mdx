Hello World is built with Medplum's [React Component](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-introduction--docs) library, which is a great resource for rapid prototyping and building internal tools.

## Clone and Run the App[​](#clone-and-run-the-app "Direct link to Clone and Run the App")

This tutorial assumes you have already:

* Registered for a Medplum account. (If not [registration instructions](/docs/tutorials/register))
* Imported one or more sample patients. (If not [import sample data](/docs/tutorials/importing-sample-data))

First, make sure you have Node JS and npm installed. If not, follow instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Next, clone the Medplum Hello World repo

```
git clone https://github.com/medplum/medplum-hello-world.gitcd medplum-hello-world
```

Next, install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

Then, run the app

```
npm run dev
```

You should be able to access the Hello World app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You can stop the Node JS process using `Ctrl+C`.

## Explore Medplum Hello World[​](#explore-medplum-hello-world "Direct link to Explore Medplum Hello World")

The Medplum Hello World demo is a simple application that presents a list of current patients, along with detailed patient information.

In this section, we'll familiarize ourselves with functionality of the Hello World demo. Follow-on tutorials will dive deeper into how the app was built.

### Sign-in[​](#sign-in "Direct link to Sign-in")

The first page of the demo asks you to sign in using the Medplum credentials you set up in the the [registration tutorial](/docs/tutorials/register).

After entering your credentials, you will prompted to select a Medplum project. Click on the name on the project that you registered in the Tutorial 1, and you'll be redirected to the Hello World home page.

### Home Page[​](#home-page "Direct link to Home Page")

Once you log in, you'll be presented with a greeting, along with a list of all the patients in your Medplum project. Assuming you [imported sample data](/docs/tutorials/importing-sample-data), there will be two patients.

### Practitioner Profile[​](#practitioner-profile "Direct link to Practitioner Profile")

Click on the link in the "Welcome" greeting to access the Practitioner profile page.

This page uses the Medplum's [`ResourceTable`](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-resourcetable--patient) component to display basic data about the profile resource of the logged-user. You can read more about profile resources [here](/docs/tutorials/register#invite-a-new-user).

### Patient Profile[​](#patient-profile "Direct link to Patient Profile")

Click on the "Hello World" link in the top left corner to return to the homepage.

Click on any individual patient name to navigate to the patient details page. This page has three different views of the patient data:

* The **Overview** panel demonstrates how to use plain HTML to create a custom view of patient data, including linked [ServiceRequests](/docs/api/fhir/resources/servicerequest) and [DiagnosticReports](/docs/api/fhir/resources/diagnosticreport).
* The **Timeline** panel uses Medplum's built-in [`PatientTimeline`](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-patienttimeline--patient) component to add comments, upload files, and display relevant events related to the Patient.
* The **History** A view uses the Medplum's built-in [`ResourceHistoryTable`](https://storybook.medplum.com/?path=/docs/medplum-resourcehistorytable--basic) component to display the history of changes to the Patient resource.

## Conclusion[​](#conclusion "Direct link to Conclusion")

You've now built and run a simple custom UI built on top of the Medplum platform!

Medplum Hello World is a very simple app intended to help developers learn the Medplum platform. The following tutorials will dive into details of how this application was built.

Medplum also maintains more feature-rich example applications that companies can use as a starting point for building their own experiences:

* [**Foo Medical**](https://github.com/medplum/foomedical): An example patient portal, complete with messaging, vital signs, and vaccination records.
