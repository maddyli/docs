## Obtaining Credentials[​](#obtaining-credentials "Direct link to Obtaining Credentials")

This tutorial assumes you already have a Medplum account. (If not, please [register](https://app.medplum.com/register).)

Create a [ClientApplication](https://app.medplum.com/ClientApplication) if one does not already exist. You can create a new ClientApplication on the [Project Admin page](https://app.medplum.com/admin/clients).

For this example you will need the `ID` and `Secret`.

## Connecting to the service[​](#connecting-to-the-service "Direct link to Connecting to the service")

Execute an HTTP POST request to the OAuth2 Token endpoint:

**Note:** If you are hosting this on localhost, without editing the configuration file, the URL will be `http://localhost:8103/oauth2/token`

On success, the response will be a JSON object with the following properties:

```
{  "token_type": "Bearer",  "access_token": "<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>",  "expires_in": 3600}
```

The value of "access\_token" can then be used in future requests for authentication.

Alternatively, you can initiate the process in the Medplum Client by using the [`startClientLogin`](/docs/sdk/core.medplumclient.startclientlogin) convenience method.
