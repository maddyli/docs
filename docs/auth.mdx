title: "Overview"
description: "This page helps you choose the correct authentication method for your application, whether it's a browser, a server, or a device. The primary goal is to guide you to the right documentation page based on your use case."
---

For **user-facing applications (web or mobile apps)**, use [*browser-based authentication*](#browser-based-authentication).

<Warning>
  The Medplum App ([https://app.medplum.com](https://app.medplum.com)) is an administrative tool for clinical users and developers. Patients **cannot** log in to this application directly. To provide patient access, you must build a custom patient portal using the Medplum SDK.
</Warning>

For applications running in a **trusted, back-end environment**, use [*server-side authentication*](#server-side-authentication).

## Browser-based Authentication[​](#browser-based-authentication "Direct link to Browser-based Authentication")

This category is for user-facing applications that connect directly to Medplum. These applications run in untrusted environments (browsers, native apps) and use **identity providers** to authenticate a user.

| Method                                                         | **Choose to...**                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Medplum as IDP](/docs/auth/medplum-as-idp)                    | (default) **Get going fast**, and don't have external compliance requirements.                 |
| [External IDP](/docs/auth/external-identity-providers)         | Connect to an external IDP, like [Google Auth](/docs/auth/google-auth), Auth0, or AWS Cognito. |
| [Domain-level IDP](/docs/auth/domain-level-identity-providers) | Use your enterprise, domain-level **corporate identity solution.**                             |

## Server-side Authentication[​](#server-side-authentication "Direct link to Server-side Authentication")

This category is for back-end services. These applications do not directly authenticate a user but operate on behalf of an application or device. They can be used to:

* integrate with legacy systems
* connect to a medical device
* build a proxy API
* connect to a CI/CD pipeline

Use the [**Client Credentials Flow**](/docs/auth/client-credentials) to allow your application to use its own client key and secret to obtain a token. When working through proxy API layers, you can [enable on-behalf-of authentication](/docs/auth/on-behalf-of) with client credentials to act on behalf of other entities.

## User Management[​](#user-management "Direct link to User Management")

See our [User Management](/docs/user-management) section for more information:

* scoping users, and distinguishing [Project vs Server Scoped users](/docs/user-management/project-vs-server-scoped-users)
* enabling [Open Patient Registration](/docs/user-management/open-patient-registration)
* using [External ID's](/docs/user-management/external-ids)
* creating [Custom Emails](/docs/user-management/custom-emails) for user invites

***

## Security Best Practices[​](#security-best-practices "Direct link to Security Best Practices")

Regardless of the authentication method you choose, always follow these best practices:

* **Principle of Least Privilege**: Ensure your `ClientApplication` and user access policies are as restrictive as possible.
* **Secrets Management**: Never store credentials or tokens directly on disk. Use a secrets management service.
* **Network Isolation**: Restrict host access via a VPC or firewall to prevent access from the public internet.
